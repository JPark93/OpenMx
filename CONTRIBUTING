Background:

http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/gpl-non-gpl-collaboration.html

Project policy:

We use a "file-by-file" method of copyright inventory. The comment
block at the top of a source file declares which license covers that
particular source file. Individual contributors hold copyright over
the chunks of code that they submit (unless otherwise noted), as
documented by source code control software that records the project's
history.

All contributions are expected to be licensed Apache 2.0.

Contributions are Apache 2.0 by default.
